    Today, I got set up to work on my <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121b-course/week05/ponder_prove-wwb.html">05 Prove assignment</a>. I also did a bit of coding on it. Tomorrow I will be spending a few hours trying to get it completed and picking out a project to work on next week. For this project, I am pulling info via json file from a website and reformatting it for display on a different web page. Right now, I have some of the data displayed. I still need to display more data and make sure everything is formatted correctly.
