Day 1

Monday, 8 August, 2022

When I decided to complete the 100 days of code challenge, I had previously tried to complete the HackerRank List Comprehension coding challenge and quickly got stuck. I had been running into a lot of that with my coding efforts of late, and I hated the idea. I knew that getting stuck was going to be an inevitability, but I was not prepared for the number of dead ends I was running into, and the only paths I was not hitting dead ends on, were ones that were not stretching me. 

So, despite not feeling ready to make the leap, I went ahead and jumped into the 100 days of code challenge. I first went back to the File Extension project I started in connection with the HarvardX CS50â€™s Intro to Python class I am taking via EdX, but still ran into a dead end on that one. I technically got a little farther (which was cool) but it was not enough. 

So, I went back to the last HackerRank challenge I tried to start and actually got it completed! 
While I now understand List Comprehensions a lot better, I do not like the sacrifice I have to make in code readability to accomplish it. I feel that if I were ever to have to go back to it, then I would likely have to start from scratch at trying to understand what is happening. Perhaps that might change down the road, but right now, I think I want to stick with more readable code than shorter code. 


Day 2

Tuesday, 9 August, 2022

Yesterday, I struggled a lot with the list comprehension and had a hard time conceiving of even a strategy to use to solve the problem with. Today, when I first got started, I ran into the same problem, and like yesterday, I looked at what others had done to solve the problem and tried to dissect that. From there, I stopped and asked myself, "Seeing how these people solved the problem, how could I have figured it out?" From there, I immediately had ideas flowing into my mind for how I could have solved the problem and created a solution that I did not see in the discussion board for the problems. To me, this is a huge win because it means that I am starting to learn what I believe is the most important part of learning programming, specifically problem solving. 

Day 3

Wednesday, 10 August, 2022

Today was a first for my HackerRank challenges. I did not have to look at the solutions that others thought of first to figure out how they completed it, I thought of a solution simply from things I had previously done. After writing this, I still plan to look and see what others did for their solutions, simply because I feel the alternate perspectives is valuable for learning, but I am happy to see my growth in programming skills and especially my increased problem solving skills. I am really loving this 100 day challenge. I wonder how my coding skills will have improved by December of 2023 when I will actually stop my coding challenge (assuming I have a job by then at least).

One thing I learned from today's coding is the importance of both stopping to carefully read the challenge and (as I think this will help) using psudocode to outline what I plan on doing. My first 2 attempts at checking what I thought was completed code, were wrong because I had not paid close enough attention to what was required in the challenge. 

Day 4

Thursday, 11 August, 2022

Today, I spent a few hours watching videos trying to learn a bit more about python dictionaries. I might not have had to spend as much time learning if I had not been working at the time, but it was the best time I had so I am happy I did it. In the end, I found a video on Youtube that walked you through the problem and I realized that I was way over complicating it, and that in many ways, all I needed to do was to treat the dictionary like a list and that would have solved the problem. 

Day 5

Friday, 12 August, 2022

Today, I found that some of the HackerRank challenges are terribly worded. I also got to where I wanted to know more about how functions worked, as I felt that was holding me back, so I decided to resume working ahead in my next class and was able to get two whole assignments completed. In the second of those programs (called discount.py) I even found a place where it just made sense to write funtions. We have not actually gotten to where they have taught us how to write functions yet, but I have had enough exposure to them, that I know the basics. I also know just how valuable functions will be in programming, so I am happy to see that I am starting to see the benifit of using them. 

Day 6

Saturday, 13 August, 2022

Today, I practiced working with files, while loops and if statements. I added data to a text file for the first time, which was cool. I am doing a better job at not over complicating things. Tomorrow, I am looking forward to stopping and worshipping. 

Day 7

Monday, 15 August, 2022

Today, I practiced with creating functions. Specifically, I practiced with creating the whole program within various functions. And connected with that, I practiced with using one function inside of another. One good rule of thumb I learned that I want to remember is to try to avoid having a function longer than 20 lines of code. I would imagine that if it is getting that long it is likely better to just create a separate function. 

Day 8

Tuesday, 16 August, 2022

Today, I practiced more with functions. Before I started this journey, functions were something I was just starting to experiment with, and in many ways, was uncomfortable with them, but now, I am getting ready to not only write my own functions, but to use an existing library of functions in such a way that would have left me intimidated before. I am also seeing the advantage of using notes to outline your program. The coding work I have been doing the past few days, has been work that will be due as part of a class I will be taking in September. I chose to start working on it now, because I realized that my lack of knowledge about functions was holding me back and I did not like that idea. I think that while I will still have a lot to learn, after the work I am planning on doing tomorrow, I will be happy with where I am at on functions. I will likely keep working ahead in my class, because I like that idea. I am really happy I started this 100 days of code journey. 

Day 9

Wednesday, 17 August, 2022

Some days are just going to be busier than others I guess. Today was one of those busy days, but I still got my coding in. I practiced more working with functions, both writing my own and working with existing functions and libraries. Today, was a lot of deciphering code and libraries. I am trying to build a Python program that will draw and image, and this will be my first program that does not run exclusively in the terminal. It is wonderfully complex and enjoyable. I did not get the program done, but I am learning a lot more on this one so I am fine with that. The goal is not to complete a project every day, but to spend an hour coding, and while it was not all spent writing code, a lot of it was spent trying to decipher code and translate it into my needs, but I learned a lot and feel happy with the work I did. 

Day 10

Thursday, 18 August, 2022

Today was another busy day, but I still got my coding in. It took some dedicated work, but I got my coding in. I practiced more with functions and learned about ways to make code more reusable. 

Day 11

Friday, 19 August, 2022

I got a few hours in today. I watched two whole lectures on coding from Harvard's CS50 class (via YouTube) and a bunch of shorter videos. During my actual coding time, I practiced more with functions and with for loops. I ran onto a bug with the for loop I was working with, I got the first iteration to work but nothing after that seemed to work and I am not sure why. So tomorrow, I will be trying to do some troubleshooting. 

Day 12

Saturday, 20 August, 2022

I really love mornings! I spent an hour coding in the morning and made a lot of progress. I finally got the forest generating properly. Next, I want to generate three mountains, and the edge of a cliff that I want to put into the scene, giving the user the feel of standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking a mountain valley on the way to 3 big mountains. 

The problem I had with the loop is that I was not properly handling the incrementation of the loop. I had the line of code that would increase the position of where the program was trying to draw the tree inside of the if statement that was being used to decide if a tree would be drawn, instead of at the end of the for loop itself, which meant that the position of the tree was never incramented and so the program was just drawing 30 trees right in the same position. 

Day 13

Monday, 22 August, 2022

I got the program I have been working with done, or at least I got it close enough. There is technically a bug with it as the mountain in the center is supposed to have snow on it, and does not, but I am ready to move on to learning new things and I can always come back to this later. I have spent enough time on this project and I am ready to start learning new things, so that is what I plan to do. 

Day 14

Tuesday, 23 August, 2022

Today, for a bit, I did not feel like practicing coding, but then I reminded myself of my dream and had a lot of fun coding. I practiced working with local and global variables as well as troubleshooting code. 

Day 15

Wednesday, 24 August, 2022

Today, I worked more with functions, and iterating through lists. Following the assignment given in the week 4 Team activity for my next programming class (which I am working ahead in) I built a program that will calculate the storage and cost efficiency of different can sizes. I wanted to go one step farther and have the program display the can type with the highest storage efficiency and best cost efficiency but I ran out of time. Either way, I am happy with how the program turned out. I do need to get better at leaving notes in my code. 

Day 16

Thursday, 25 August, 2022

There is certainly a lot more opposition to trying to find an hour to code every day than I ever imagined there would be. While I did not get as much time as I wanted, I still am happy with the time I got in, so I will count today as a success. I completed a few coding challenges on an app I have on my phone. 

Day 17

Friday, 26 August, 2022

Today, I went back to my 04 Prove assignment and worked out a few bugs, along with getting the program set up to be more dynamic and scalable. 

Day 18

Saturday, 27 August, 2022

I finished my 04 prove project. It took a lot of work and fine tuning but I am happy with it. The only thing I would love to fix is to get the sun into a more stable position when you adjust the size of the scene. From this experience, one of the biggest things I learned was about how much tweaking it can take to draw things with code.  .

Day 19 

Monday, 29 August, 2022

Today, was my first day of working with pytest and building code to test functions. I likely did more learning than I did coding but I have to start somewhere. One of my first take aways about testing functions is the realization of just how much work and code it takes to build a test for a function. While for classroom examples that are kept deliberately simple, it might seem like writing code to test functions is not worth it, I can see the value in it when you get to where things are much more complex. I remember a "adventure game" program I wrote that would have been so much easier to test if I had written it in functions and then just wrote code to test the functions. I can also see why people may not like to write code to test their functions. A question that is already running through my mind is how could I improve the process of testing functions? That makes me happy, because that means I have found at least one area I am interested in within the coding world. 

Day 20

Tuesday, 30 August, 2022

Today, I worked with two different programs, one of which had problems with it, that I needed to write tests for. The specific challenge was to first figure out what the program was supposed to do based on the documentation and then build a test for it to find where the problem might be, and then use the test results to fix the problem. I quickly learned about the value of making sure you code everything right. There were a few bugs I ran into from errors I made when writing the test code. This lesson also taught me a lot about the value of documenation; as without proper documentation within the code, it would have been a lot harder to build tests for it. 

Day 21

Wednesday, 31 August, 2022

While I did not get much in the way of coding done today, I feel the work I did was valuable. The work I was doing involved a lot of things that we were just told to do without any kind of explanation to how it worked and to me, it felt too much like a tutorial that I was following and so I decided to stop and dig a little deeper. I have more I will be studying tomorrow because I just want to know, but that is alright because this journey is about developing my skills, and sometings that requires stopping to learn and not just practice. 

Day 22

Thursday, 1 September, 2022

Today was another day focused mostly on learning. I ended up watching two harvard lectures and got my code outlined a little better for what I will be doing tomorrow. 

Day 23

Friday, 2 September, 2022

Between time spent actually coding and time spent learning coding, I spent close to 9 hours of time on coding today. Tomorrow, I am ready to dive headfirst into more programming. 

Day 24

Saturday, 3 September, 2022

I got my hour of coding in first thing in the morning and then planned to do more after I got a few things done, but the day got crazy and I never got back to it. 

Day 25 

Monday, 5 September, 2022

Today, I went back to HackerRank and completed another challenge. Specifically, I completed the HackerRank Lists challenge, fond here. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-lists/problem In the practice I have done over the past few weeks working ahead in my class, I figured out a few questions I had about some of the things I was seeing at HackerRank like for example the header they populate in (if __name__ == "__main__":) I now know that allows for you to do things like unit test your code without actually running the full program and is meant to be put before the main function. It also allows for you to use your code in other programs via importing them. From there, I practiced more with pull requests on Github and completed my second pull request. 

Day 26

Tuesday, 6 September, 2022

I went to try another HackerRank problem but when I ran into something that I could not find an answer to and that everyone I found online simply took for granted, I got annoyed and went back to working ahead in my class. I figured out the problem I ran into last night and found another one, then fixed it. I also got more practice with completing pull requests, reviewing code, and tracking problems. I am actually enjoying this process. 

Day 27 

Wednesday, 7 September, 2022

Today, I spent most of my time figuring out how to create issues in Github from my VS code. I want to get familiar with the tools and with the process of learning how to use new tools as I feel that will help set me up for when I actually get a programming job. I also figured out two simple projects I want to build to add to my portfolio. I got the idea from a video Andy Sterks that linked to a wonderful Github repository. https://github.com/andysterks/three-levels-of-projects The first two projects I want to make are an Expense Tracker and a Weight Tracker App. 

Day 28 

Thursday, 8 September, 2022

Today, I completed a few challenges on codewars. I needed something relaxing to counter the stress I have been under, but still wanted to do my coding. 

Day 29

Friday, 9 September, 2022

Today, I went back to some of the code I previously completed and tightened it up a bit and added better documentation. It was simple, but I enjoyed the practice of refining my code. 

Day 30

Saturday, 10 September, 2022

Today, I officially started my CSE111 Programming with functions class. As I found the Syllabus and most of the assignments online and used that to start working ahead, I have just taken the formal start of the class to go back and review and polish up my code. I did that yesterday and today. I rather enjoy reviewing my code. I learn a lot from doing it. 

Day 31

Monday, 12 September, 2022

I formally decided today to adjust my classes for this semester. My programming with functions class is now a block class that will be completed at the end of October and then right after that, I will start my JavaScript Language class. I wanted to take the JavaScript class earlier because I want to have more time to get used to it so I can start building programs in both JavaScript and Python, which I feel will be better for my job prospects. For programming, I learned what refactoring is (or at least got a brief introduction to it) and so to use proper terminology, I spent my day refactoring code I previously wrote before submitting it. I have now submitted weeks 1 through 4 and just have the code I wrote for week 5 and the first part of week 6 to refactor and then turn in. I rather like going back and reviewing and polishing up my code. I find ways to make it better and more efficient. In some ways, I think I learn as much looking back at code I previously wrote and fixing it as I do writing code. 

Day 32

Tuesday, 13 September, 2022

Today, I spent several hours diving through the Pytest documentation and spent some time refactoring some old code. I have now turned in my work through lesson 5 and just have a little bit to do on Lesson 6 and then I will be back to writing new code. The reason I am taking my time is to make sure that I got it all right. 

Day 33

Wednesday, 14 September, 2022

Today, I worked a bit more on my sentences program and got the next part built into it. I now need to build the tests for the two new functions I wrote and then add a bit more to the program to be formally done. Tomorrow, I will write the tests for the functions I wrote today. 

Day 34

Thursday, 15 September, 2022

I was planning on writing some test functions, but forgot that I had a meeting with my programming group. Today, I taught my new programming group about writing functions and lead a group discussion on building a program to meet the qualifications of an assignment we were given.
