Day 1

Monday, 8 August, 2022

When I decided to complete the 100 days of code challenge, I had previously tried to complete the HackerRank List Comprehension coding challenge and quickly got stuck. I had been running into a lot of that with my coding efforts of late, and I hated the idea. I knew that getting stuck was going to be an inevitability, but I was not prepared for the number of dead ends I was running into, and the only paths I was not hitting dead ends on, were ones that were not stretching me. 

So, despite not feeling ready to make the leap, I went ahead and jumped into the 100 days of code challenge. I first went back to the File Extension project I started in connection with the HarvardX CS50â€™s Intro to Python class I am taking via EdX, but still ran into a dead end on that one. I technically got a little farther (which was cool) but it was not enough. 

So, I went back to the last HackerRank challenge I tried to start and actually got it completed! 
While I now understand List Comprehensions a lot better, I do not like the sacrifice I have to make in code readability to accomplish it. I feel that if I were ever to have to go back to it, then I would likely have to start from scratch at trying to understand what is happening. Perhaps that might change down the road, but right now, I think I want to stick with more readable code than shorter code. 


Day 2

Tuesday, 9 August, 2022

Yesterday, I struggled a lot with the list comprehension and had a hard time conceiving of even a strategy to use to solve the problem with. Today, when I first got started, I ran into the same problem, and like yesterday, I looked at what others had done to solve the problem and tried to dissect that. From there, I stopped and asked myself, "Seeing how these people solved the problem, how could I have figured it out?" From there, I immediately had ideas flowing into my mind for how I could have solved the problem and created a solution that I did not see in the discussion board for the problems. To me, this is a huge win because it means that I am starting to learn what I believe is the most important part of learning programming, specifically problem solving. 

Day 3

Wednesday, 10 August, 2022

Today was a first for my HackerRank challenges. I did not have to look at the solutions that others thought of first to figure out how they completed it, I thought of a solution simply from things I had previously done. After writing this, I still plan to look and see what others did for their solutions, simply because I feel the alternate perspectives is valuable for learning, but I am happy to see my growth in programming skills and especially my increased problem solving skills. I am really loving this 100 day challenge. I wonder how my coding skills will have improved by December of 2023 when I will actually stop my coding challenge (assuming I have a job by then at least).

One thing I learned from today's coding is the importance of both stopping to carefully read the challenge and (as I think this will help) using psudocode to outline what I plan on doing. My first 2 attempts at checking what I thought was completed code, were wrong because I had not paid close enough attention to what was required in the challenge. 

Day 4

Thursday, 11 August, 2022

Today, I spent a few hours watching videos trying to learn a bit more about python dictionaries. I might not have had to spend as much time learning if I had not been working at the time, but it was the best time I had so I am happy I did it. In the end, I found a video on Youtube that walked you through the problem and I realized that I was way over complicating it, and that in many ways, all I needed to do was to treat the dictionary like a list and that would have solved the problem. 

Day 5

Friday, 12 August, 2022

Today, I found that some of the HackerRank challenges are terribly worded. I also got to where I wanted to know more about how functions worked, as I felt that was holding me back, so I decided to resume working ahead in my next class and was able to get two whole assignments completed. In the second of those programs (called discount.py) I even found a place where it just made sense to write funtions. We have not actually gotten to where they have taught us how to write functions yet, but I have had enough exposure to them, that I know the basics. I also know just how valuable functions will be in programming, so I am happy to see that I am starting to see the benifit of using them. 

Day 6

Saturday, 13 August, 2022

Today, I practiced working with files, while loops and if statements. I added data to a text file for the first time, which was cool. I am doing a better job at not over complicating things. Tomorrow, I am looking forward to stopping and worshipping.
