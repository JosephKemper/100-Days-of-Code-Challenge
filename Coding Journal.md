Day 1

Monday, 8 August, 2022

When I decided to complete the 100 days of code challenge, I had previously tried to complete the HackerRank List Comprehension coding challenge and quickly got stuck. I had been running into a lot of that with my coding efforts of late, and I hated the idea. I knew that getting stuck was going to be an inevitability, but I was not prepared for the number of dead ends I was running into, and the only paths I was not hitting dead ends on, were ones that were not stretching me. 

So, despite not feeling ready to make the leap, I went ahead and jumped into the 100 days of code challenge. I first went back to the File Extension project I started in connection with the HarvardX CS50â€™s Intro to Python class I am taking via EdX, but still ran into a dead end on that one. I technically got a little farther (which was cool) but it was not enough. 

So, I went back to the last HackerRank challenge I tried to start and actually got it completed! 
While I now understand List Comprehensions a lot better, I do not like the sacrifice I have to make in code readability to accomplish it. I feel that if I were ever to have to go back to it, then I would likely have to start from scratch at trying to understand what is happening. Perhaps that might change down the road, but right now, I think I want to stick with more readable code than shorter code. 


Day 2

Tuesday, 9 August, 2022

Yesterday, I struggled a lot with the list comprehension and had a hard time conceiving of even a strategy to use to solve the problem with. Today, when I first got started, I ran into the same problem, and like yesterday, I looked at what others had done to solve the problem and tried to dissect that. From there, I stopped and asked myself, "Seeing how these people solved the problem, how could I have figured it out?" From there, I immediately had ideas flowing into my mind for how I could have solved the problem and created a solution that I did not see in the discussion board for the problems. To me, this is a huge win because it means that I am starting to learn what I believe is the most important part of learning programming, specifically problem solving. 

Day 3

Wednesday, 10 August, 2022

Today was a first for my HackerRank challenges. I did not have to look at the solutions that others thought of first to figure out how they completed it, I thought of a solution simply from things I had previously done. After writing this, I still plan to look and see what others did for their solutions, simply because I feel the alternate perspectives is valuable for learning, but I am happy to see my growth in programming skills and especially my increased problem solving skills. I am really loving this 100 day challenge. I wonder how my coding skills will have improved by December of 2023 when I will actually stop my coding challenge (assuming I have a job by then at least).

One thing I learned from today's coding is the importance of both stopping to carefully read the challenge and (as I think this will help) using psudocode to outline what I plan on doing. My first 2 attempts at checking what I thought was completed code, were wrong because I had not paid close enough attention to what was required in the challenge. 

Day 4

Thursday, 11 August, 2022

Today, I spent a few hours watching videos trying to learn a bit more about python dictionaries. I might not have had to spend as much time learning if I had not been working at the time, but it was the best time I had so I am happy I did it. In the end, I found a video on Youtube that walked you through the problem and I realized that I was way over complicating it, and that in many ways, all I needed to do was to treat the dictionary like a list and that would have solved the problem. 

Day 5

Friday, 12 August, 2022

Today, I found that some of the HackerRank challenges are terribly worded. I also got to where I wanted to know more about how functions worked, as I felt that was holding me back, so I decided to resume working ahead in my next class and was able to get two whole assignments completed. In the second of those programs (called discount.py) I even found a place where it just made sense to write funtions. We have not actually gotten to where they have taught us how to write functions yet, but I have had enough exposure to them, that I know the basics. I also know just how valuable functions will be in programming, so I am happy to see that I am starting to see the benifit of using them. 

Day 6

Saturday, 13 August, 2022

Today, I practiced working with files, while loops and if statements. I added data to a text file for the first time, which was cool. I am doing a better job at not over complicating things. Tomorrow, I am looking forward to stopping and worshipping. 

Day 7

Monday, 15 August, 2022

Today, I practiced with creating functions. Specifically, I practiced with creating the whole program within various functions. And connected with that, I practiced with using one function inside of another. One good rule of thumb I learned that I want to remember is to try to avoid having a function longer than 20 lines of code. I would imagine that if it is getting that long it is likely better to just create a separate function. 

Day 8

Tuesday, 16 August, 2022

Today, I practiced more with functions. Before I started this journey, functions were something I was just starting to experiment with, and in many ways, was uncomfortable with them, but now, I am getting ready to not only write my own functions, but to use an existing library of functions in such a way that would have left me intimidated before. I am also seeing the advantage of using notes to outline your program. The coding work I have been doing the past few days, has been work that will be due as part of a class I will be taking in September. I chose to start working on it now, because I realized that my lack of knowledge about functions was holding me back and I did not like that idea. I think that while I will still have a lot to learn, after the work I am planning on doing tomorrow, I will be happy with where I am at on functions. I will likely keep working ahead in my class, because I like that idea. I am really happy I started this 100 days of code journey. 

Day 9

Wednesday, 17 August, 2022

Some days are just going to be busier than others I guess. Today was one of those busy days, but I still got my coding in. I practiced more working with functions, both writing my own and working with existing functions and libraries. Today, was a lot of deciphering code and libraries. I am trying to build a Python program that will draw and image, and this will be my first program that does not run exclusively in the terminal. It is wonderfully complex and enjoyable. I did not get the program done, but I am learning a lot more on this one so I am fine with that. The goal is not to complete a project every day, but to spend an hour coding, and while it was not all spent writing code, a lot of it was spent trying to decipher code and translate it into my needs, but I learned a lot and feel happy with the work I did. 

Day 10

Thursday, 18 August, 2022

Today was another busy day, but I still got my coding in. It took some dedicated work, but I got my coding in. I practiced more with functions and learned about ways to make code more reusable. 

Day 11

Friday, 19 August, 2022

I got a few hours in today. I watched two whole lectures on coding from Harvard's CS50 class (via YouTube) and a bunch of shorter videos. During my actual coding time, I practiced more with functions and with for loops. I ran onto a bug with the for loop I was working with, I got the first iteration to work but nothing after that seemed to work and I am not sure why. So tomorrow, I will be trying to do some troubleshooting. 

Day 12

Saturday, 20 August, 2022

I really love mornings! I spent an hour coding in the morning and made a lot of progress. I finally got the forest generating properly. Next, I want to generate three mountains, and the edge of a cliff that I want to put into the scene, giving the user the feel of standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking a mountain valley on the way to 3 big mountains. 

The problem I had with the loop is that I was not properly handling the incrementation of the loop. I had the line of code that would increase the position of where the program was trying to draw the tree inside of the if statement that was being used to decide if a tree would be drawn, instead of at the end of the for loop itself, which meant that the position of the tree was never incramented and so the program was just drawing 30 trees right in the same position. 

Day 13

Monday, 22 August, 2022

I got the program I have been working with done, or at least I got it close enough. There is technically a bug with it as the mountain in the center is supposed to have snow on it, and does not, but I am ready to move on to learning new things and I can always come back to this later. I have spent enough time on this project and I am ready to start learning new things, so that is what I plan to do. 

Day 14

Tuesday, 23 August, 2022

Today, for a bit, I did not feel like practicing coding, but then I reminded myself of my dream and had a lot of fun coding. I practiced working with local and global variables as well as troubleshooting code.
