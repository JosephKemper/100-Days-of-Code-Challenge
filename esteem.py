Problem Statement
The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is a self-esteem measure developed by the sociologist Morris Rosenberg in 1965. 
It is still used in social-science research today. 
To complete the measure, a person completes a survey that contains the following ten statements.

I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.
I feel that I have a number of good qualities.
All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.
I am able to do things as well as most other people.
I feel I do not have much to be proud of.
I take a positive attitude toward myself.
On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.
I wish I could have more respect for myself.
I certainly feel useless at times.
At times I think I am no good at all.
The person responds to each statement by choosing one of these four options: 
strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree. 
The person's response to each statement is worth 0â€“3 points, 
meaning the highest possible score is 10 * 3 = 30 points. 
If a person scores lower than 15 points, the person may have a problematic low self-esteem.

Notice that five of the statements (numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 7) are positive and are scored like this:

Choice	Points
Strongly Disagree	0
Disagree	1
Agree	2
Strongly Agree	3
The other five statements (numbers 3, 5, 8, 9, 10) are negative and are scored like this:

Choice	Points
Strongly Disagree	3
Disagree	2
Agree	1
Strongly Agree	0
