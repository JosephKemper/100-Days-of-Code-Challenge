    Today, I got set up to work on my <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121b-course/week05/ponder_prove-wwb.html">05 Prove assignment</a>. I also did a bit of coding on it. Tomorrow I will be spending a few hours trying to get it completed and picking out a project to work on next week. For this project, I am pulling info via json file from a website and reformatting it for display on a different web page. Right now, I have some of the data displayed. I still need to display more data and make sure everything is formatted correctly.

    It took a lot of work but I finally got my 05 Prove assignment completed. Running out of time, will have to put more in here later. I spent from about 8 am this morning until just after 6 pm working on my lesson 5 prove assignment. I built a web page that pulled data from a website on temples and pulled data from the json file, placed it into an array, and iterated through the array to place the data in custom created html elements. In the process, I combined different pieces of data about each temple and put it into a combined html article element, then added the ability to sort the different temple articles in either ascending or descending order. The biggest problem I had was in trying to figure out how to clear the data previously generated on the page to allow for it to be sorted another way.

    I studied all of the prepare content for this lesson and started on the first ponder activity for the week. I refactored some food to make it work more efficiently and to actually follow the dry principle.

    Today, I refactored a little more code. I used the JavaScript Map function and pulled data from an array in a more reusable manner than the original code did. I also decided that instead of starting new rounds every time I get to 100, I am just going to keep on counting days. So, instead of being on day 3 of my second round, I am on day 103, because I am not going to stop until either I get a job, or I graduate, whichever comes last.

    I Finished the last of the ponder activities and started mapping out my final project for my JavaScript Class. What I am planning to do, is to build a web page to display some of my poems. I am not sure if I will be able to get all of them put into the page, because of how many I have written (likely somewhere in excess of 5,000). My plan is to pull a picture of the Mount Timpanogos Temple and put it at the top. From there, I will reference that Deanne and I were married there on 13 October 2012 and will calculate how long we have been married. From there, I will give a few options to display love poems beneath a picture of the Mount Timpanogos Temple. This gets into the parts that I am not sure if I will have time to finish, but even if I cannot finish it during class, I will finish it afterwards, because I know my wife will love this project. Ideally, I want to have an option to display every poem that was written on that day, during a prior year, or just a random poem from that day in a prior year. I kind of want a few more options for filtering but I am not sure what else I would want to do yet.

    Today, I planned out and started working on my poems webpage. I got a bit of code written and got the files and folders organized. There will be a few things I will have to figure out, but for the most part, I think I should be able to put everything together.

    Continued working on my webpage and figured out how I will pull a specific array out of a compound array. The data in question, is pulled from a website and gets converted from a JSON file to a JavaScript array. So, I need to be prepared for the data to change, and possibly come in a different order. After trying a few different ways, I will be building a function to loop through the data and check if the templeName key is Mount Timpanogos Temple, and then assigning all of that data to an array and returning it for use in my page.

    So far, I have worked for about 4 hours on what is supposed to be a three hour project, and am not even close to being done. I might have just found a fix for an error, that I will be testing out now.
