    Today, I got set up to work on my <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121b-course/week05/ponder_prove-wwb.html">05 Prove assignment</a>. I also did a bit of coding on it. Tomorrow I will be spending a few hours trying to get it completed and picking out a project to work on next week. For this project, I am pulling info via json file from a website and reformatting it for display on a different web page. Right now, I have some of the data displayed. I still need to display more data and make sure everything is formatted correctly.

    It took a lot of work but I finally got my 05 Prove assignment completed. Running out of time, will have to put more in here later. I spent from about 8 am this morning until just after 6 pm working on my lesson 5 prove assignment. I built a web page that pulled data from a website on temples and pulled data from the json file, placed it into an array, and iterated through the array to place the data in custom created html elements. In the process, I combined different pieces of data about each temple and put it into a combined html article element, then added the ability to sort the different temple articles in either ascending or descending order. The biggest problem I had was in trying to figure out how to clear the data previously generated on the page to allow for it to be sorted another way.

    I studied all of the prepare content for this lesson and started on the first ponder activity for the week. I refactored some food to make it work more efficiently and to actually follow the dry principle.

    Today, I refactored a little more code. I used the JavaScript Map function and pulled data from an array in a more reusable manner than the original code did. I also decided that instead of starting new rounds every time I get to 100, I am just going to keep on counting days. So, instead of being on day 3 of my second round, I am on day 103, because I am not going to stop until either I get a job, or I graduate, whichever comes last.

    I Finished the last of the ponder activities and started mapping out my final project for my JavaScript Class. What I am planning to do, is to build a web page to display some of my poems. I am not sure if I will be able to get all of them put into the page, because of how many I have written (likely somewhere in excess of 5,000). My plan is to pull a picture of the Mount Timpanogos Temple and put it at the top. From there, I will reference that Deanne and I were married there on 13 October 2012 and will calculate how long we have been married. From there, I will give a few options to display love poems beneath a picture of the Mount Timpanogos Temple. This gets into the parts that I am not sure if I will have time to finish, but even if I cannot finish it during class, I will finish it afterwards, because I know my wife will love this project. Ideally, I want to have an option to display every poem that was written on that day, during a prior year, or just a random poem from that day in a prior year. I kind of want a few more options for filtering but I am not sure what else I would want to do yet.

    Today, I planned out and started working on my poems webpage. I got a bit of code written and got the files and folders organized. There will be a few things I will have to figure out, but for the most part, I think I should be able to put everything together.

    Continued working on my webpage and figured out how I will pull a specific array out of a compound array. The data in question, is pulled from a website and gets converted from a JSON file to a JavaScript array. So, I need to be prepared for the data to change, and possibly come in a different order. After trying a few different ways, I will be building a function to loop through the data and check if the templeName key is Mount Timpanogos Temple, and then assigning all of that data to an array and returning it for use in my page.

    The biggest factor I have found in trying to find good online sources is to first have a good understanding of what I am trying to do, for without that foundation, I have found that too often you end up getting advice on topics that really do not affect what you are trying to accomplish. From there, I have found that the best sources are those that have complete examples which you can implement and try on your own before trying it inside of your code. Just to hear someone explain the syntax of what should happen is not enough, and just to see someone else point out what was wrong with the code, is not enough either. For the best sources, I want to see examples of how the code should look and work along with an explanation of why. Many, but not all, of the answers on Stackoverflow, have wonderful insights. I typically, find that Stackoverflow, is typically a source to better figure out what I am trying to accomplish. For JavaScript, I have found that a lot of sources are kind of hit or miss. 
</p>
<p>
    https://www.educba.com/ has a lot of underwhelming sources, and a few good ones. 
</p>
<p>
    https://www.w3schools.com/ has a lot of really good examples, but not a lot of great explanations. 
</p>
<p>
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript has a lot of great examples and wonderful explanations, but is typically hard to navigate. 
</p>
<p>
    YouTube has a lot of wonderful videos, that both let me see live the explanation and the examples, but also has a lot of people who sound like they know what they are talking about but when you try to follow what they are talking about, you quickly find holes. 
</p>
<p>
    Probably the best overall source is a good old fashioned internet search engine (i.e., Google). 
</p>
<p>
    For my processes, I start with a search engine, and try to find a place to start. Often times Stackoverflow ends up on the top of that list. I look at a few questions and answers there, and use that to refine what I am looking for. Sometimes, I luck out and find a direct answer there. From there, if I am still having problems trying to better define what I am trying to accomplish, then I might turn to YouTube. From there, I go back to the search engine and refine my search. At that point, I typically find an answer via one of other sites mentioned above. I do not limit myself to those sites, the ones I mentioned are simply the ones that come up the most. 
</p>
<p>
    One of the reasons I so highly praise both examples and explanation is that it is really hard to fake both when you do not actually know what you are talking about, especially if you provide the code examples for someone like me to test out and experiment with.

    I spent another 2 hours on my program. I learned how to use the find function in JavaScript. Initially, for a reason I could not figure out, when I tried to use the find function, it was pulling the first item in the array regardless of whether it matched the desired results or not. From there I figured out how to implement the find function using arrow notation inside of the main function I am using to find the URL I am looking for, and that almost let me get what I wanted. 
</p>
<p>
    The initial results did not let me pull the image URL out of the compound list. To fix that, I adjusted the export function to specifically export the image. Tomorrow, I am going to attach the image to an HTML element and display our wedding date and try to calculate our how long we have been married. I doubt I will get much farther than that. I really need to get better at estimating how long a project will take.

    Picked up my study of algorithms again, and discovered that at least part of that study will be carried out via pencil and paper, because it will help me to think efficiently. I also touched up my webpage a little, but most of my work today was reading.

    Today in my study of algorithms I learned about big O notation. Big O notation is a measure of the number of steps something will take to compute. For example O(n) means that if you have 10,000 items you are calculating, then it will take 10,000 steps to calculate. While O(n*n) means that if you have 10 items then it will take 100 steps to calculate.

    I finally have a company selected that I want to work at! The first company on my list of companies that I want to work for is Salesforce.

<p>
    I just learned what the opposite of raising something to the power of another item is, it is a Logarithm. There are quite a few versions of logarithms that can all impact how we view the efficiency of algorithms. The most efficient algorithms have solid time, and take the same number of steps no matter how many items they are calculating. The next best is a logarithmic algorithm.

<p>
    A Eulerian Circuit, or a path that goes through a series of nodes ending in the same place it started and only traveling each path once, is only possible if the sum of all the paths is an even number. 
</p>
<p>
    A multi graph or directed graph is one that has arrows that direct the flow of traffic between one node and another. Hyperlinks between webpages are an example of a directed graph in the internet. 
</p>
<p>
    An acyclic graph is a graph that does not have a cycle like an Eulerian Circuit. Directed Acyclic graphs are often called dags.

    Today, I started learning about search algorithms. Obviously ordered search is easier and more efficient that unordered search. The most basic search is compared to finding a needle in a haystack, you just go through the items one by one until you find what you are looking for. Regardless of the method you use for selecting items, (top down, bottom up, or randomly) the principle is the same. I also learned about the basic principles in searching unordered lists. The basic steps of linear or sequential search is that you start at the first item in your list, and move one by one through it until you get to the end.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the head of the list.</li>
    <li>If the item is the one we are looking for, report that it is found and stop.</li>
    <li>Go to the next item on the list.</li>
    <li>If we are at null, report that the search item was not found and stop. Otherwise, return to step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The big O notation for an unordered list is O(n), because in a worst case scenario the search will take a number of steps equal to the number of items we are searching within.

    I started learning about the Matthew effect on search today, wherein the search algorithm moves items closer to the top after finding them. One of the first things that came to my mind for the advantage of the Matthew effect is the Pareto principle (or the 80/20). As I thought about the idea of reorganizing the items in the list, I quickly realized that the Pareto principle would eventually take effect and greatly speed up search results.
